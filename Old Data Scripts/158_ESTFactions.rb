 ** EST - BRIBE AND BATTLE ROYALE v1.2
 author : estriole 
 
 licences:
 Free to use in all project (except the one containing pornography)
 as long as i credited (ESTRIOLE).
 
 version history
 v1.0 - finish the script
 v1.1 - change some method to alias for better compatibility
 v1.2 - add some method alive and dead method for each faction & bribed
 now you could use
 $game_party.alive_faction_a_members.size
 to check how many faction_a members still alive
 or
 $game_party.alive_bribed_members.size
 to check how many bribed members still alive
 (will be use for actor recruiting system add on later. but still stuck a little
 on it :D)
 
 this script have two function:
 1) make bribed enemy:
 bribed enemy will attack other enemy beside all bribed members. how you make the 
 enemy to be bribed. just add the state to that enemy. 
 (for the bribe system is up to you ex: bribed by hitting enemy with skill that 
 give money, for complex one... enemy have loyalty, etc)
 
 note: bribed enemy is excluded from $game_troop.alive_members
 so you cannot hit them (hey they are your allies... don't hit kill them will you)
 unfortunately i haven't added function so our actor could heal the bribed enemy.
 since it need to rewrite the windows actor selection. and could be problems
 with compatibility with other script.
 
 2) do battle royale
 currently this support battle royale.
 we assign enemy to faction. example: 
 slimeA, slimeB is faction A
 batA, batB is faction B
 then slime will hit either our party or faction B members.
 and bat will hit either our party or faction A members.
 thus the battle royale begin
 
 to set the faction just add the state at battle start using troop event pages
 example : turn 0. 
 slimeA +faction A state, slimeB +faction A state 
 BatA +faction B state, BatB +faction B state.
 
 this script already tested to work with normal battle system and
 victor animated battle system (victor map battle havent tested yet)
 i also used it with yanfly ace battle engine.
 if any bugs occur using above system just tell me and i will try to fix it.
 
 unfortunately i don't use other battle system and thus i might not make
 compatibility with other battle system. especially tankentai (just because it's
 hard to make compatibility with tankentai)..
   
 FOR SCRIPTER ONLY
 if you want more than two factions... example 6 team battle royale...
 (althought i doubt how you set the troops position :D)  
 just do this following steps
 1) add in module ESTRIOLE the faction state
 2) define the faction_x? method (see faction a and b example)
 3) add one more conditional in check_custom_opponents_unit_value
    if faction_x?
    faction_opponents_unit = Game_Troop.new
    faction_opponents_unit.setup_faction_opponents(ESTRIOLE::FACTION_X_STATE)
    @custom_opponents_unit = faction_opponents_unit
    end
    
    after if faction_b? condition and above if bribed? condition
    
 4) do the same with def check_custom_friends_unit_value
    if faction_x?
    faction_friends_unit = Game_Troop.new
    faction_friends_unit.setup_faction_friends(ESTRIOLE::FACTION_X_STATE)
    @custom_friends_unit = faction_friends_unit
    end
    
    after if faction_b? condition and above if bribed? condition
    
 done. now you have 3 faction for 4 way battle
