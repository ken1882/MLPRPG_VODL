#==============================================================================
# ▼ Introduction
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
# RPG Maker VX Ace certainly gives a lot of control to developers over many
# aspects of designing their RPG including custom formulas for individual items
# and skills. However, the program does not offer custom formulas for some of
# the more unique parameters such as hit rates, evasion rates, critical rates,
# etc. This script provides the ability to alter those extra parameters with
# primary stats altering them such as LUK affecting critical, DEF affecting PDR
# and whatnot.
# 
#==============================================================================
# ▼ Instructions
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
# To install this script, open up your script editor and copy/paste this script
# to an open slot below ▼ Materials/素材 but above ▼ Main. Remember to save.
# 
# Modify the formulas in the script module to your liking.
# 
#==============================================================================
# ▼ Compatibility
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
# This script is made strictly for RPG Maker VX Ace. It is highly unlikely that
# it will run with RPG Maker VX without adjusting.

    # that affect them, as well.
