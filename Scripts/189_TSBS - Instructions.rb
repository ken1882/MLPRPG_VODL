  * ) Opening :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Okay, at first I only wanted to use this script as personal use. As a 
  objection why it was so hard to understand other's Battle Engine. I just 
  don't get the way they works. So, I decided to learn how to script my own 
  battle engine
  
  My hope is, when I finish this script, so I can make my own Sideview
  Battle system's sequence without learn other's scripts. In other means that
  if I feel that something is missing, I can add them by myself without asking
  people which may going to be unanswered. And I'm suck at English
  anyway ....
  
  So, how about you as script user? Well, I may accept any comments or 
  bug reports. Since it's my masterpiece, I will provide my best support to you. 
  However, I can not guarantee about compatibility patch with someone's script
  which I don't really like it.
  
  Well, sorry if I can't explain this TSBS well and if is so tedious to use. 
  Let just get started then
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * ) How to install :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Make sure that you take these script list in your editor :
  >> Config 1 - General
  >> Config 2 - Sequence
  >> Implementation
  
  Put the Theo - Basic Modules v1.5b all above custom script. If you're using
  YEA - Core or Battle Engine, put that above this script. This script also
  need to be placed above main as well.
  
  If you're using Yami Damage Popup or Luna Engine, place their script above
  my TSBS
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * ) Spriteset Rules :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Spriteset files must be inside Graphics/Battler. And the file name must
  begin with battler's name (actor / enemy) and ended with number. For
  examples :
  
  - Eric_1.png
  - Eric_2.png
  - Slime_1.png
  - Slime_2.png
  
  The number is for sequence setup. You will find it out later.
  If you wonder how the spriteset should be, find that out in "Config 1"
  
  ==========================================================================
                                NOTETAGGING!
  ==========================================================================
  * ) ACTOR NOTETAGS :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Use these tags in actor notebox :
  
  <sideview>
  idle : key
  critical : key
  hurt : key
  dead : key
  intro : key
  victory : key
  escape : key
  return : key
  counter : key
  <sideview>
  
  Replace the 'key' with a hash key that you have set it up in action 
  sequences (config 2 - sequence). These options are :
  
  idle      >> Sequence for idle pose
  critical  >> Sequence if the HP is in critical condition
  hurt      >> Sequence if the battler get hit
  dead      >> Sequence if the battler is knockout (dead is too xtreme)
  intro     >> Sequence for battle intro
  victory   >> Sequence for victory pose
  escape    >> Sequence for escape
  return    >> Sequence for returning back to original position
  counter   >> Sequence for counter attack
  
  For examples :
  
  <sideview>
  idle : Eric_IDLE
  critical : Eric_CRI
  </sideview>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR BATTLER FOLDER (for easier organize)
  <folder: name>
  
  For easier organize, you could make a subfolder in "Graphics/Battler". For
  example, you want to create a new directory named "Graphics/Battler/actors"
  and you want all the actor battlers placed on the new directory. So the
  battler graphics wont be messed up. All you need yo do is to put a simple
  notetag in actor notebox. Example :
  
  <folder: actors>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR NORMAL ATTACK AND GUARD
  <attack: id>
  <guard: id>
  
  By default, attack skill and guard id are 1 and 2. But you could set them
  manually for each actor. So, by using the notetags above, actor could have 
  unique attack skill id. Example
  
  <attack: 3>
  <guard: 4>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR COUNTERATTACK SKILL
  <counter skill: id>
  
  By default, actor's counter skill is 1. You can replace it by insert this 
  notetag
  
  <counter skill: 4>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR MAGIC REFLECTION ANIMATION
  <reflect anim: id>
  
  An animation that will be played during magic reflection on magic victim.
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR NO SHADOW
  <no shadow>
  
  Use this tag if you don't want actor to show shadow
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR CUSTOM SHADOW
  <shadow: filename>
  
  Use this tag if you want to specify actor shadow using a certain image
  The file must be exist in Graphics/system

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR SHADOW POSITIONING
  <shadow pos: +n>
  <shadow pos: -n>
  
  Use this tag to set the shadow position. Positive is for downward and 
  negative is for upward. Default one is 4
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR CUSTOM FLIP
  <custom flip>
  
  There is a certain case where you need asimetic battler. Like if you have
  a character who have an eyepatch in his right eye. But when it flipped, his
  eyepatch will be misplaced in his left eye.
  
  To overcome this problem, you could use <custom flip> notetag for actor.
  However, you should provide the graphics by using this name format.
  
  Eric_1_flip.png
  
  ==========================================================================
  * ) ENEMY NOTETAGS :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Use these notetags to enemy notebox if you want the enemy also use spriteset
  as actor did. If you don't use these notetags, the enemy will be static. That 
  is up to you
  
  <sideview: battlername>
  idle : key
  critical : key
  hurt : key
  evade : key
  return : key
  counter : key
  collapse : key
  </sideview>
  
  The explanation is same as actor notetags. But, you have to replace the
  'battlername' with the file name that you're going to use it as enemy's 
  spriteset
  
  For example, you can write it like this :
  <sideview: slime>

  So, it will use these image file names :
  slime_1, slime_2, slime_3 etc ...
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR BATTLER FOLDER (for easier organize)
  <folder: name>
  
  For easier organize, you could make a subfolder in "Graphics/Battler". For
  example, you want to create a new directory named "Graphics/Battler/enemies"
  and you want all the enemy battlers placed on the new directory. So the
  battler graphics wont be messed up. All you need yo do is to put a simple
  notetag in enemy notebox. Example :
  
  <folder: enemies>

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR COUNTERATTACK SKILL
  <counter skill: id>
  
  By default, enemy's counter skill is 1. You can replace it by insert this 
  notetag
  
  <counter skill: 4>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR MAGIC REFLECTION ANIMATION
  <reflect anim: id>
  
  An animation that will be played during magic reflection on magic victim.
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG UNTUK BATTLER FLIP
  
  For some enemy graphics, the original direction face is left. Such as
  kaduki sprites. And if you want it to be flipped, you could use this tag
  <flip>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR NO SHADOW
  <no shadow>
  
  Use this tag if you don't want actor to show shadow
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR CUSTOM SHADOW
  <shadow: filename>
  
  Use this tag if you want to specify actor shadow using a certain image
  The file must be exist in Graphics/system

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR SHADOW POSITIONING
  <shadow pos: +n>
  <shadow pos: -n>
  
  Use this tag to set the shadow position. Positive is for downward and 
  negative is for upward. Default one is 4
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG UNTUK COLLAPSE SOUND
  <collapsound: name, vol, pitch>
  
  Use this tag if you want to specify collase sound effect for a certain enemy.
  Replace the 'name' with SE filename, and replace 'volume' and 'pitch' with
  number. The default collapse sound is same as the enemy collapse from the 
  system database.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR CUSTOM FLIP
  <custom flip>
  
  There is a certain case where you need asimetic battler. Like if you have
  an enemy who have an eyepatch in his right eye. But when it flipped, his
  eyepatch will be misplaced in his left eye.
  
  To overcome this problem, you could use <custom flip> notetag for actor.
  However, you should provide the graphics by using this name format.
  
  Eric_1_flip.png

  ==========================================================================
  * ) WEAPON AND CLASS NOTETAGS :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR NORMAL ATTACK AND GUARD
  <attack: id>
  <guard: id>
  
  By default, attack skill and guard id are 1 and 2. But you could set them
  manually for each classes. So, normal attack would change if actor
  changing the class or wielding a different weapon. Example :
  
  <attack: 3>
  <guard: 4>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR CHANGE BATTLER GRAPHIC
  <classname: name>
  
  Want to change the battler graphic when changed job? Use this notetag.
  Replace 'name' with additional name that you want as battler name.
  
  As example :
  - Your actor name is Eric_1.ong
  - His class name is warrior. You put the notetag <classname: -warrior>
  - Now the new battler name is Eric-warrior_1.png

  ==========================================================================
  * ) WEAPON NOTETAGS :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR NORMAL ATTACK AND GUARD
  <attack: id>
  <guard: id>
  
  By default, attack skill and guard id are 1 and 2. But you could set them
  manually for each weapons. So, normal attack would change if actor
  changing the class or wielding a different weapon. Example :
  
  <attack: 3>
  <guard: 4>
  
  Note :
  1. Class attack ID priority is higher than actor
  2. Weapon attack ID priority is higher than class. In other word,
     preferred attack ID will be picked from weapon than class even though both
     has same notetags
  3. If character is dual wield, attack ID is taken from the first weapon
     (or if you have better idea, tell me)
     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTETAG FOR WEAPON ICON FILE
  <iconfile: filename>
  
  If you feels like the regular icon is too small, you have an alternative to
  show the icon using picture by adding the notetag above into the weapon 
  notebox. I will tell you later how to use in config 2 on the icon sequence
  part. The graphic you plan to use should existed on the Graphics/system
  
  Example :
  <iconfile: sword>

  ==========================================================================
  * ) SKILL / ITEM NOTETAGS :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Use this tag to set preparation sequence before the skill is executed
  \preparation : key_sequence
  
  Use this tag to set action sequence
  \sequence : key_sequence
  
  Use this tag to set return sequence after performing action
  \return : key_sequence
  
  If you're using three times \sequence in skill/item notebox with different key
  sequence, the result will be randomized. In other means, that you could have 
  three  different sequence on skill/item
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  AREA DAMAGE :
  
  <area>
  By default, if the target number is two or higher (such as 3 random enemies), 
  the skill sequence will be executed as many as the target number. By adding
  <area> tag in skill/item notebox, the action sequence will be executed one 
  time.
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO RETURN SEQUENCE :
  
  <no return>
  By default, each skill/item sequence was finished, the return key sequence
  will be called. But, for some case, calling return sequence is not
  necessary. So, you can add <no return> tag to your skill/item notebox to
  prevent calling return sequence.
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ABSOLUTE TARGETING :
  
  <abs-target>
  Sometimes, a random targeting causes target the same enemy. If you want
  two random target is really absolute, which mean that the targeted enemy
  won't be attacked twice, you can add <abs-target> tag in skill/item notebox
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MAGIC REFLECT ANIMATION :
  
  By default, an animation that will be played to magic caster during magic
  reflection is same as it's skill animation. If you want to change it to
  another animation, you can use this tag
  <reflect anim: id>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PARALLEL ANIMATION :
  
  By default, animation that will be played on target when the target has 
  animation guard, then the regular animation will be replaced by anim guard.
  in order to play both in parallel, input this tag
  <parallel anim>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RANDOM TARGET REFLECTION :
  
  By default, target of the magic reflection is the magic attacker itself. If
  you want to make magic reflection target to be randomized. You can use this
  tag in skill/item notebox
  <random reflect>
  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ONE ANIMATION DISPLAY :
  
  By default, when a battler perform area skill and play the animation, it will
  be played in each target. This tag will prevent it to happen. Instead, the
  animation will be played once in the middle of the targets. Use this tag
  in skill / item notebox
  <one animation>
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  These are some special tags for skill
  <always hit>    || The skill won't be missed
  <anti counter>  || The skill can not be counterattacked
  <anti reflect>  || The skill can not be reflected
  
  <ignore skill guard>  || The skill will be ignore target's skill guard
  <ignore anim guard>   || The skill animation will be ignore target's animation
  guard
  
  What is skill guard and animation guard anyway?
  Read it below
  
  ==========================================================================
  * ) STATE NOTETAGS :
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  State Tone & Color :
  -------------------------
  You can also define the color or tone alteration of the battler if the battler 
  is inflicted a certain state by inserting these notetag. There are two modes.
  Tone and Color.
  
  <tone: red,green,blue,gray>
  <color: red,green,blue,alpha>
  
  Replace RGB with any number you want. It should be around 0 - 255. You can
  set minus operand if you want to reduce some color composition. Note that 
  minus ONLY works for tone. Tone is same as tint screen in event
  
  Example :
  <tone: -30,80,-60,0>
  <color: 0,0,0,150>
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Animation Guard :
  -------------------------
  Anim guard is an animation that will be played if the target is being 
  attacked and is currently under influence a certain state. For example, the 
  battler is currently under protection of magic barrier. So, if the battler is 
  being attacked, it will be play barrier protection. (see Lunar's Spellshield
  in my sample game)
  
  Use this notetag :
  <anim guard: n>
  Replace n with a number that represent animation ID
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Skill Guard :
  -------------------------
  Skill guard is a counter skill that will be applied to attacker. Not a 
  literally counter though. For example, if the battler is under 'poison skin' 
  state, anyone who attack him will be infected by poison state or such.
  (see Flay's Corrosive skin OR Soleil's flamecloak in my sample game)
  
  Use this notetag :
  <skill guard: n>
  Replace n with a number that represent skill ID
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  State Opacity :
  -------------------------
  In case that if you want the battler to be transparent, you can use this
  feature. For example, the 'hide' state will prevent enemy to target. The 
  battler will be in displayed in half transparent
  
  Use this tag :
  <opacity: n>
  Replace n with a number value that should go around 0 - 255
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  State Sequence :
  -------------------------
  You can also define custom idle sequence when the battler is under influence
  of a certain state. For example, if battler is being stuned, so the battler 
  will be down or such. Use this tag
  
  \sequence : key_sequence
  
  It is similar as skill sequence tag.
  To be noted that state sequence is considered as idle sequence
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  State Animation :
  -------------------------
  It is similar as YEA - State Animation. But I'm going to make my own. If
  the battler is under influence of a certain state, you can play a repeated
  animation by adding this tag to state notebox.
  
  <animation: id>
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  State Animation Behind :
  -------------------------
  As a support for state animation, now you could make the state animation
  played behind the battler by put this following notetag
  <anim behind>
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  State Transformation :
  -------------------------
  Request from a dear friend, and also as my idea to add this feature. If 
  battler under influence of a certain skill, then the graphic could be changed
  based on the state. i.e, transform to another form. Use this tag
  <transform: name>
  
  Where the "name" is an additional name placed after battler name. Example :
  - Battler name is Eric_1
  - You have a state tagged with <transform: -dragon>
  - Then the new graphic filename must be exist is Eric-dragon_1
  
  Note :
  > If there're many transformation states, the one which has top priority will
    be used
  > If you use this together with classname and custom flip, then the new name
    format is more like this
    
    basename + classname + statename + index + flip
    
    Example :
    EricWarriorDragon_1_flip.png
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  State basic actions modification :
  -------------------------
  Same as notetag for normal attack and guard. State could modify basic action
  for actor as well. And state has the higher priority over the others. So,
  attack ID will be taken from state if there's any
  
  Use this following notetag :
  <attack: id>
  <guard: id>
